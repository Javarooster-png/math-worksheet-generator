# math-worksheet-generator
I made this because the website I was using to generate math worksheets wanted me to pay for premium to generate more.

This is still a wip program. It can not generate division problems yet. Designed for elementary schoolers to practice their math skills. 

dependencies: python3, fpdf2

Usage:
python3 math_gen.py will generate multiplication problems by default
python3 math_gen.py --sub will generate subtraction problems
python3 math_gen.py --add will generate addition problems

The default number of pdf files generated is 5 and the default range of numbers is 0 through 10
